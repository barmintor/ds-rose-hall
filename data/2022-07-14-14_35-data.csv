He was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall; he was listed as African, negro (in colour), and 30 years old at that time. In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, he was noted as 44 years old, “able and healthy,” and of “good” disposition. In the 1832 list Aaron was described as the “Head Penkeeper.” As Head Penkeeper he would have been responsible for the overall raising and breeding of livestock at Rose Hall. It is possible that Aaron had labored at Rose Hall for many years and even decades before 1817; the details of Aaron’s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.

Adam’s birth was noted in the 1826 Slave Register; in that register, he was described as Creole, negro (in colour), 1 year old, and son of Matilda (Creole). In the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, Adam was listed as 6 years old and a “cattleboy”; the other cattleboys were all Creole—James, Oliver, William Kerr, Othello, and (younger) Isaac. It is unclear how long Adam had been working as a cattleboy; it is important to note that even at the age of 6, Adam already had an established position with related duties at Rose Hall. Like many enslaved children, Adam was actively involved in the workings of the plantation. Although Adam was not listed as such, many enslaved children were part of what was called the “hogmeat gang.” As part of this group, enslaved children often between the ages of 5 and 9 at sugar plantations in Jamaica and in other parts of the Americas assisted with disposing of trash, weeding grass, carrying manure from one place to another to fertilize the sugarcane plants, collecting food for livestock, and other chores. The details of Adam’s life after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Adam’s biological father. Matilda’s other children at Rose Hall (and Adam’s siblings) included Marcus and Sylvia. It is also possible that Matilda had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall. Matilda’s mother, Nancy (Creole), was Adam’s maternal grandmother. The extant records do not include information about all of Adam’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora.",Animal Caretakers
2,P3,Adonis,,,,Creole,Negro,Male,25.0,,,,,,,,,,25.0,,,,,,39.0,Head Cooper,Yaws,Drunkard,110.0,Adonis,"Adonis was Creole. Adonis was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall, and he was listed as Creole, negro (in colour), and 25 years old at that time. In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, he was noted as 39 years old, a “drunkard,” and with “yaws” (frequently known now as an infectious childhood disease that is often debilitating and disfiguring as it affects the skin, bone, and cartilage). In the 1832 list Adonis was described as the “Head Cooper.” As a cooper, Adonis would have been an artisan/craftsperson skilled at making wooden barrels (often called hogsheads and tierces at the time) to contain and ship the items enslaved people produced at Rose Hall (including sugar, rum, and molasses). As Head Cooper, he would have been responsible for the overall creation, repair, and supervision of these containers. The Rose Hall Journal noted that Adonis ran away on May 29, 1830 “on being ordered to work in the field” (vol. 3, folio 74). Adonis’ position as Head Cooper had removed him from laboring as a field worker. It is not clear what had transpired for Adonis to be “ordered to work in the field.” His health challenges with yaws may well have impacted his use of rum to assuage the painful symptoms of this disease. His description as a “drunkard” may have resulted in the punishment of being ordered to the fields. Whatever the reason for the order, Adonis decided to run away instead of working in the fields. It is unclear when Adonis returned or was brought back to Rose Hall. However, in 1832, 2 years after his runaway attempt, he was listed as Head Cooper. The extant records do not include information about all of Adonis’ familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or the African diaspora. We do not know the names of Adonis’ parents. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we also do not know whether Adonis was a biological father of children at Rose Hall or had additional children in Jamaica or in other parts of the African diaspora.

Allick was 1 of 2 enslaved people at Rose Hall with this name. The other person named Alick (also referred to as Allick) at Rose Hall was also Creole. This Allick’s birth was recorded in the Rose Hall Journal on September 4, 1820. The journal stated: ""Dorinda delivered of Male Child Sept. 3d."" (vol. 1, folio 168). Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Allick’s biological father. A newborn’s name was not always included in the Rose Hall Journal at the time of their birth; however, the information in other extant records provides confirmation of his name associated with this particular birth of Dorinda’s. Allick’s birth was also included in the 1823 Slave Register, and he was described as Creole and negro (in colour). As with countless other infants born in bondage in Jamaica and in other parts of the Americas, Allick’s birth and passing were noted in the same 1823 Slave Register; the age recorded at the time of passing is 1 year old. The Rose Hall Journal included a note that Allick died of yaws on January 8, 1821 (vol. 1, folio 186b). In fact, Allick did not live to the age of 1 (as recorded in the 1823 Slave Register); instead, when he passed in early January 1821, he was 4 months old. The extant records do not include information about all of Allick’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora. In the archival documents, Allick’s mother Dorinda (Creole) was described as the only midwife at Rose Hall. She had at least 9 children at Rose Hall (5 of her children survived from birth to 1832—Sam, Anthony, William, Venus, and John). Dorinda (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of multiple children. At least 4 of Dorinda’s children passed before reaching the age of 5—3 sons (Morris, Allick, Surry) and a daughter named Eliza. We do not know how Allick’s passing affected Dorinda specifically. Being the midwife at Rose Hall, and having experienced the passing of multiple children of her own, might have exacerbated the range of feelings Dorinda grappled with related to the births and deaths of her children and the children of other women at Rose Hall.",Unknown

Alick’s mother was Mary (Creole), and Mary’s mother was Maphe (Creole). Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Alick’s biological father. As with countless other children born in bondage in Jamaica and in other parts of the Americas, Alick’s passing at 2 years old was also noted (due to “fever”) in the Rose Hall Journal on February 24, 1832 (vol. 3, folio 117). By the time Alick passed in February 1832, Mary had at least 6 children at Rose Hall. When Alick passed, 3 of Mary’s children were alive—Ned described as samb0/mulatto, Sally Rose described as sambo/mulatto, and Jimmy described as sambo. In addition to Alick’s passing, Mary’s son John described as sambo passed by the age of 1. Soon after Alick’s passing, the Rose Hall Journal notes that Mary had a miscarriage, and mentions that Mary was in the area called the “hospital” at Rose Hall during the first half of September 1832 recovering from this miscarriage (vol. 3, folios 132-134).

Anthony was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall, and he was listed as Creole, negro (in colour), 7 years old at that time, and son of Dorinda (Creole). In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, he was noted as 21 years old, “able and healthy,” and of “good” disposition. In the 1832 list Anthony was described as a “muleman.” He was 1 of 2 mulemen listed in the 1832 list; the other muleman was North (Creole). As a muleman he was responsible for the overall care of Rose Hall’s mules. He also assisted with tending other livestock at Rose Hall. On one occasion in August 1826, Anthony was supposed to be tending cattle with brothers Ben (Creole) and Pitt (Creole). Instead, a Rose Hall Journal entry noted that he absconded from Rose Hall with them; as a result, some of the cattle left the pen and destroyed a significant portion of sugarcane plants (vol. 2, folio 164). Notations in the Rose Hall Journal indicate that between 1821 and 1829 Anthony ran away at least 8 times on his own and with other enslaved men. Anthony’s first recorded runaway attempt, at the age of 11, was noted in the journal on September 17, 1821 (vol. 1, folio 222). The journal did not include any additional reports of Anthony running away together with Ben and Pitt at another time, although Anthony ran away with Pitt and Hercules (Creole) in 1822. He also ran away with Hercules and Gloster/Glouster (Creole) on separate occasions. It is likely that Anthony had been born and labored at Rose Hall since his birth; the details of Anthony’s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.

Multiple notations in the Rose Hall Journal mentioned that Archey ran away from Rose Hall on at least 15 separate occasions between 1821 and 1826. His first recorded runaway attempt, at the age of 15, was noted on November 19, 1821 (vol. 1, folio 231). After at least 11 runaway attempts, a note in the journal stated that on August 20, 1823 “Archy sent to Falmouth Workhouse for punishment” (vol. 2, folio 11). Unlike workhouses in England that functioned as almshouses, workhouses in colonial Jamaica were jails. On October 6, 1823, Archey was released and returned to Rose Hall after approximately 6 weeks at the Falmouth Workhouse. A little over a month after being released from the workhouse, Archey attempted to run away a few more times between 1824 and 1826. The final notation about Archey at Rose Hall appeared in the 1826 Slave Register; at age 20, Archey was “transported” off the island as his final punishment at Rose Hall. It is likely that Archey had been born and labored at Rose Hall until he was transported off the island; the details of Archey’s life before 1817 or after 1826 have not been uncovered at this time. Archey’s mother Zebra (Creole) was a field worker at Rose Hall. Zebra had at least 6 children at Rose Hall (4 of her children survived from birth to 1832—Rose, Dianna/Diana, James, and Charles). Zebra (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of a child. Zebra’s son Robert passed at the age of 7. Archey’s brother James also ran away from Rose Hall multiple times, and due to these runaway attempts, James was described as a “notorious runaway” in the 1832 Clothing Allowance List.

Watson,,Creole,Sambo,Male,,son of Zebra (1820),Zebra,P208,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,13.0,With Mrs. Palmer,Able and Healthy,Good,90.0,Charles (Christian/other name Charles Watson),"Charles was Creole. One other enslaved person also had the name Charlie/Charley; he was also Creole. Charles was included in the 1820 Slave Register, and he was listed as Creole, sambo (in colour), 2 years old at that time, and son of Zebra (Creole). In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, he was noted as 13 years old, “able and healthy,” and of “good” disposition. His primary duty was noted as “With Mrs. Palmer.” He was 1 of 2 enslaved persons associated with this position. The other enslaved person listed with this duty was Jane Cranston, Creole, mulatto (in colour), and 17 years old in 1832. The range of responsibilities involved in being with Mrs. Palmer is unclear. That Mrs. Palmer had 2 enslaved persons attending to her (1 male and the other female and both in their teens) may have reflected the breadth and range of duties that included domestic, personal care, as well as more involved arduous work that required the abilities of 2 enslaved people on a quotidian basis. There were other enslaved persons described in the 1832 Clothing Allowance List whose duties did not focus primarily on working in the sugarcane fields and were categorized as “domestic” work: Mary James (Creole, mulatto) was the “G.H. Attendant” (Great House Attendant), Bessy McLaren (Creole, mulatto) and Susannah Scott (Creole, negro) were “washerwomen,” Dorinda (Creole, negro) was the midwife and hospital attendant, and Rose (Creole, negro) was another hospital attendant. As was customary for births at Rose Hall, the 1820 Slave Register also noted that Charles’ mother was Zebra (Creole, negro in colour). Zebra was a field worker at Rose Hall. Zebra had at least 6 children at Rose Hall (4 of her children survived from birth to 1832—Rose, Dianna/Diana, James, and Charles). Zebra (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of a child. Zebra’s son Robert passed at the age of 7. Zebra’s son Archey was the only person listed as transported off the island due to his frequent runaway attempts. Zebra’s son James also ran away from Rose Hall multiple times, and due to these runaway attempts, James was described as a “notorious runaway” in the 1832 Clothing Allowance List. The extant records do not include information about all of Charles’ familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Charles’ biological father. Given that Charles was categorized consistently as sambo, and his mother Zebra was listed consistently as negro, his father was probably mulatto.",Domestic Workers

One other enslaved person also had the name Charles; he was also Creole. Charlie was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall, and he was listed as Creole, negro (in colour), and 40 years old at that time. In the 1826 Slave Register, he was noted (as Charley) as having passed at the age of 47. Charlie’s duties at Rose Hall were not included in the archival documents; the documents did not include the reason(s) for his passing. Notations in the Rose Hall Journal indicated that between 1817 and 1825 Charley ran away at least 6 times on his own and with other enslaved persons. Charley’s first recorded runaway attempt, at the age of 40, was noted in the journal on April 21, 1817 (vol. 1, folio 2). The journal entry stated that “Charley and Doshy still away.” Doshy/Doshey was an enslaved Creole woman who ran away from Rose Hall at least 16 times between 1817 and 1822—the most recorded runaway attempts by any enslaved woman at Rose Hall. Doshy’s runaway attempts would probably have continued had it not been for her passing on November 8, 1823; the 1826 Slave Register noted that she was 28 years old at the time of her passing. Charley also ran away multiple times with Arabella. Arabella was an African-born enslaved woman who, like Doshy, absconded from Rose Hall numerous times; Arabella ran away at least 13 times between 1817 and 1832. Indeed, in the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, Arabella was noted as a runaway and absent from Rose Hall at the time the list was being prepared. Charley also ran away multiple times with Mercury (Creole). Mercury’s multiple runaway attempts resulted in his imprisonment in the Montego Bay jail in January 1821. Two weeks after he was imprisoned, a Rose Hall Journal entry mentioned that Mercury passed in the Montego Bay jail (vol. 1, folios 187 and 189). Charley also ran away with January on separate occasions. In the journal entries, Charley was described as having absconded from Rose Hall solo, as well as at the same time as Mercury or Arabella or with all 3 being listed as “still away” (vol. 1, folios 3, 4, 40, 50, 51, 55, 141, 143, 146, 147, and 149). A journal entry noted Charley’s final departure from Rose Hall on August 1, 1825 (vol. 2, folio 112). Only 3 months later, another journal entry noted that “an old Negro Man named Charley found dead in the Woods, absconded from here on the 1st of August 1825—an Inquest was held. Verdict died by the Visitation of God” (vol. 2, folio 126). Although the inquest must have been arranged due to questions surrounding Charley’s passing in the woods. It is unclear what particular issues were raised at the time. It is possible that self-imposed injuries or injuries caused by another person might have resulted in Charley’s passing. In the end, his passing was deemed a divine act at the “old” age of 47. It is possible that Charley had labored at Rose Hall for many years and even decades before 1817; the details of Charley’s life before 1817 have not been uncovered at this time. The extant records do not include information about all of Charley’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or the African diaspora. We do not know the names of Charley’s parents.

Only a few years after they ran away together, Archey was transported off the island due to his numerous runaway attempts. The date when Colin returned or was brought back to Rose Hall was not included in the journal. The 1829 Slave Register listed Colin’s passing at the age of 41.

On some plantations, enslaved drivers also were responsible for meting out punishments to other enslaved people for refusing to work or engaging in untoward activities. In the 1828 Annual Clothing Allowance List George is among few who receive extra yards of osnaburg and peniston. The receipt of additional cloth was probably a result of his particular position.

Campbell),"Harry was Creole. He was described in the 1817 register as Creole, negro (in colour), 21 years old, and son of Cecelia (African-born). In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, Harry was noted as 35 years old, “able and healthy,” and of “good” disposition. His primary position was described as “Second Driver.” He was 1 of 3 drivers listed in the 1832 list. George (Creole) was listed as “Head Driver” and Janet as “driveress.” As Second Driver, Harry would have been responsible for assisting the Head Driver George in directing and supervising other enslaved persons who labored as field workers. On some plantations, enslaved drivers also were responsible for meting out punishments to other enslaved people for refusing to work or engaging in untoward activities. Harry was noted to have run away once during this time period with his brother, Smith (the blacksmith), and George (the Head Driver). On Friday July 10, 1829, it was noted in the Rose Hall Journal that they “absconded on the 10th Inst. cause Theft” (vol. 3, folio 50). Although there is no indication of what item(s) were stolen, it was likely that the men collectively engaged in this “crime” and ran away to avoid punishment. However, it is unclear whether one or all of these men were punished for their involvement in this theft and/or for absconding from Rose Hall. It is possible that Harry had labored at Rose Hall for years before 1817, but the exact details of Harry’s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Harry’s biological father. Cecelia’s other children at Rose Hall (and Harry’s siblings) were Liddy and Smith. Cecelia’s grandchildren (and Harry’s nieces and nephew) were Pastora, North, and Parish. It is also possible that Cecelia had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall.

Henry was 1 of 2 enslaved people at Rose Hall with this name. The other person, named Henry McLean, was Creole and mulatto (in colour), and son of Mary James. This Henry's birth was recorded in the Rose Hall Journal on December 10, 1826. The journal stated that “Christianna delivered male child Henry” (vol.2, folio 180b). Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Henry’s biological father. A newborn’s name was not always included in the Rose Hall Journal at the time of their birth. Henry’s birth was also included in the 1829 Slave Register, and he was described as Creole and negro (in colour) at birth; yet, in the same register he is described as mulatto (in colour) at death. As with countless other infants born in bondage in Jamaica and in other parts of the Americas, Henry’s passing was also noted in the same 1829 Slave Register; the age recorded at the time of passing is 2 years old. Although the reason for Henry’s passing is not stated, given his age at time of death, he probably passed in 1828 or even months shy of 1829. We do not know how Henry’s passing specifically affected his mother Christianna. Christianna’s only runaway attempt is noted in the Rose Hall journal on July 16, 1829 which may have been as a result of her son’s passing. Given that Christianna’s job was at the overseer’s house and that both Henry and her other child, Jane, were categorized as mulatto, it is possible that her circumstances related to the overseer might also have contributed to her desire to run far away from Rose Hall. Christianna’s mother (and Henry’s grandmother) was Miranda (African-born). Henry’s aunt and uncle (Christianna’s siblings) were Memmy Jen, Glister, and Patrick, and his cousins (Christianna’s nephews and niece) were Sam, Isaac, and Marinda. It is also possible that Christianna had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall.

He was 1 of 2 enslaved people at Rose Hall with this name. The other person, named Henry, was Creole and most likely mulatto (in colour), although he was described inconsistently in the archival records as negro (in colour) and mulatto (in colour). Henry McLean's birth was recorded in the Rose Hall Journal on August 1, 1825. That week, the journal noted “Mary James delivered of a male child named Henry McLean” (vol.2, folio 113b). In the 1826 Slave Register, Henry McLean was described as Creole, mulatto (in colour), 1 year old, and son of Mary James (Creole and mulatto). In the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, Henry McLean was listed as 6 years old, not at work (due to his age), “able,” and of “good” disposition. The details of Henry McLean’s life after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Henry McLean’s biological father. However, as Henry McLean was described as mulatto, he had a white biological father. At Rose Hall Plantation possible white fathers would have included the overseers and bookkeepers, as well as enslaver John Rose Palmer himself. Mary James was categorized as mulatto, which indicated that her father was a white man. We do not know who Mary James’s father was or what conditions led to her mother Rosannah (Creole) giving birth to Mary James. We also do not know which white man (or white men) sired Mary James’ children; she had at least 5 children at Rose Hall—2 daughters Peggy (quadroon) and Eliza Hill (mulatto), and 3 sons John Kerr (quadroon), Henry McLean (mulatto) and Edward Hill (mulatto). It is possible the Henry McLean might have been miscategorized as mulatto (instead of being described as quadroon) or his biological father might also have been mulatto. Mary James (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child—Peggy passed at 2 years old. We do not know how the passing of Peggy specifically affected Mary James. It is also possible that Mary James had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall. Mary James’s mother, Rosannah (Creole), was Henry McLean’s maternal grandmother, and Celia (Creole) was his maternal great grandmother. The extant records do not include information about all of Henry McLean’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora. Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume “consent” of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.",“Not at Work”

Hercules was described in the 1817 register as Creole, negro (in colour), and 9 years old. In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, Hercules was noted as 23 years old, “able and healthy,” and with a “bad” disposition. His primary duties and position were described as “Field” which meant he would have been one of many field workers who were responsible for planting, tending, and harvesting sugarcane in the various sections of Rose Hall Plantation. Hercules was 1 of the 4 enslaved men who were solely field workers at Rose Hall in 1832. It is possible that Hercules had labored at Rose Hall for a few years before 1817; the details of Hercules’ life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. Hercules may have been aptly named, as he ran away from Rose Hall at least 26 times. Although he is not classified as a “notorious runaway,” he absconded the most times from Rose Hall between 1817 and 1832. He was approximately 13 years old when his first runaway attempt was recorded on July 31, 1821. The overseer officially noted some form of punishment for his runaway attempts though it did not curtail Hercules’ desires to run away. On May 27, 1830, a note in the Rose Hall Journal stated that “Hercules after receiving Chastisement for his late desertion escaped once more from his [illegible word] this night” (vol. 3, folio 74). Later on October 24, 1830, the overseer relayed that “Hercules made his Escape from Confinement” (vol. 3, folio 84), which is the only reference concerning him being punished via confinement at Rose Hall. Within a month of Hercules escaping confinement, on November 16, 1830, the overseer noted, “Hercules after being pardoned for his last offense again made his exit without cause.” (vol. 3, folio 86) In only 2 of Hercules’ runaway attempts did overseers note that Hercules had “returned” and not been “brought home.” Hercules is 1 of only 3 boys (between 1 and 17 years old) in the 1817 Slave Register not described as having a biological mother at Rose Hall. Hercules may have relentlessly absconded to free himself or to see or visit loved ones, possibly including his mother and other family members located at other Jamaican plantations. The extant records do not include information about Hercules’ familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora. We do not know the names of Hercules’ parents; they could have been African-born or Creole.

This is the case with this enslaved person named Isaac. This Isaac was not listed in any of the triennial slave registers. His name was included only in a brief notation in the Rose Hall Journal for the week of March 19, 1817. A note at the bottom of the first page stated that Isaac died of “affection of the brains” (vol. 1, folio 1). “Affection of the brains” was often associated with phrenitis (inflammation of the brain), which frequently included the symptoms of acute fever and delirium. In the journal entry no information was included about his lineage or whether Isaac was African-born or Creole. The 1817 Slave Register was completed after he passed, and this is the reason for his absence in that register.

This younger Isaac was described in the 1820 register as Creole, negro (in colour), 1 year old, and son of Mimmy/Memmy Jun. His birth was recorded in the Rose Hall Journal on April 13, 182o (vol. 1, folio 148). Memmy Jun gave birth to Isaac when she was 17 years old. She passed away only a couple of years later at the age of 19 years old; the cause of death was not recorded. Isaac was still alive in 1832 and considering that his mother Memmy Jun died at a young age, it is likely that another woman (or women), as well as other persons in the Rose Hall community, continued to love and nurture Isaac. In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, Isaac was listed as 12 years old, “able and healthy,” and with a “good” disposition. His primary position was described as “Cattleboy,” and he probably worked alongside Oliver, William Kerr, Othello, Adam and James—who were also Creole and listed as cattleboys.

This James was described in the 1817 Slave Register as Creole, negro (in colour), 4 years old, and son of Zebra (Creole). In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, James was described as 18 years old, and “able and healthy.” His primary position was listed as “Cattleboy,”and he probably worked alongside Oliver, William Kerr, Othello, Adam and Isaac—who were also Creole and listed as cattleboys. James was also described as a “notorious runaway.” James ran away from Rose Hall at least 5 times between 1817 and 1832. In addition to James, 3 other cattleboys, William Kerr, Othello and Oliver, were described as “runaways” on the 1832 Clothing Allowance List. It is possible their position as cattleboys may have offered particular conditions and opportunities for their attempts. James was described as running away to avoid punishment related to 1 attempt; on June 10, 1830, a Rose Hall Journal entry noted that “James runs for fear of punishment for late rising” (vol. 3, folio 75) and that he “returned home” two days later. James also ran away at least on a couple of occasions at the same time as (or possibly with) Hercules, as the entry in the Rose Hall Journal on June 14, 1830 noted “Hercules & James once more absconded without cause” (vol. 3, folio 76). The details of James’ life after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time, but on March 20, 1832, it was recorded that James ran away (vol. 3, folio 119), and he was still away when the 1832 Clothing Allowance List was created. It is likely that James’ final runaway attempt in 1832 ended successfully with his self-emancipation, more than a year before the British Parliament’s passage of the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, which took effect on August 1, 1834.

As with countless other infants born in bondage in Jamaica and in other parts of the Americas, John’s birth and passing were noted in the same 1823 Slave Register.

Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of John’s biological father. Mary had at least 4 other children (John’s siblings)—Ned, Sally Rose, Jemmy, and Alick—most of whom were described inconsistently in the archival records as both sambo and mulatto. By 1832 only 3 of her children—Ned, Sally Rose, and Jemmy—were alive. Mary also suffered the loss of another child, Alick, in 1832. Soon after Alick’s passing, the Rose Hall Journal noted that Mary had a miscarriage, and she was in the area called the “hospital” at Rose Hall during the first half of September 1832 recovering from this miscarriage (vol. 3, folios 132-134). We do not know how the passing of multiple children specifically affected Mary. Mary’s mother (Jemmy’s grandmother), Maphe (Creole) only had one child—Mary.

Dorinda (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of multiple children.

John Kerr was described in the 1823 registry as Creole, quadroon (in colour), 1 year old, and son of Mary James (Creole). In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, John Kerr was listed as 10 years old, “able and healthy,” and of “good” disposition. His primary position was noted as “Overseer's House.” He was 1 of 3 children described as being at the overseer’s house; the other 2 children were Ned and Richard Mabon, who were all also Creole. The details of John Kerr’s life after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of John Kerr’s biological father. Although Mary James is categorized as mulatto, which indicated that her father was a white man, we do not know who Mary James’s father was or what conditions led to her mother Rosannah (Creole) giving birth to Mary James. In a similar vein, with John and his sister Peggy being categorized as quadroon, we also do not know which white man (or white men) sired these two children of Mary James. Mary James’s last three children (Henry, Eliza Hill, and Edward Hill) were described as mulatto (not quadroon or sambo), so it is unclear whether they were miscategorized as such or if the biological father or fathers of these children were also mulatto. At Rose Hall Plantation possible white fathers would have included the overseers and bookkeepers, as well as enslaver John Rose Palmer himself. Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Mary James had at least 5 children at Rose Hall (4 of her children survived from birth to 1832—John Kerr, Henry McLean, Eliza Hill, and Edward Hill). Mary James (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of a child—Peggy. It is also possible that Mary James had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall. Mary James’s mother, Rosannah (Creole), was John Kerr’s maternal grandmother, and Celia (Creole) was his maternal great grandmother.

Ben (Creole) was listed as a cartman, and Ben’s brother, Pitt (Creole), was listed as the Head Cartman. The cart was also described as the “mule cart” in the Rose Hall Journal. Mark and other cartmen were responsible for moving goods between different areas at Rose Hall, between Rose Hall and other plantations, as well as transporting the byproducts of the plantation (sugar and rum) to the wharf to be transported to England. Multiple notations in the Rose Hall Journal mentioned that Mark ran away from Rose Hall, both alone and with others, on at least 12 separate occasions between 1817 and 1831. He was noted to have run away with, or at the same time as, March (a watchman), Archey, and Arabella. On the first recorded runaway attempt, on October 15, 1818 (vol. 1, folio 74), he was 8 years old. His last recorded runaway attempt was on April 15 1832 (vol. 3, folio 121), and it is not stated if he returned or was brought back. However, he was still listed as a “runaway” in the 1832 Clothing Allowance list. It is likely that Mark’s final runaway attempt in 1832 ended successfully with his self-emancipation, more than a year before the British Parliament’s passage of the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, which took effect on August 1, 1834. The details of Mark’s life before 1817 and 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. Mark is 1 of only 3 boys (between 1 and 17 years old) in the 1817 Slave Register not described as having a biological mother at Rose Hall. The extant records do not include information about Mark’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora. Mark may have absconded to free himself or to see or visit loved ones, possibly including his mother and other family members located at other Jamaican plantations. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know whether Mark was a biological father of children at Rose Hall or had additional children in Jamaica or in other parts of the African diaspora.",Artisans and Specialists

He was described in the first slave register of 1817 as Creole, negro (in colour), and 25 years old. Multiple notations in the Rose Hall Journal mentioned that Mercury ran away from Rose Hall, both alone and with others, on at least 6 separate occasions. He was noted to have run away with, or at the same time as, Charley, Doshey, and Arabella. The 2 enslaved women, Doshey and Arabella, had absconded from Rose Hall on at least 13 separate occasions. On Mercury’s first recorded runaway attempt, on February 9, 1818 (vol. 1, folio 40), Mercury was noted to have been away for about 7 months. Though his return on August 21, 1818 was not specifically noted, on August 21st the number of runaways decreased from 2 to 1, and the other known runaway at the time, Arabella, was still noted as away (vol. 1, folio 67). On his second attempt, on October 19, 1818, he and Arabella “got away at shell blow!” (vol. 1, folio 75), The blowing of the shell was one of the signs (and often a primary sign and sound) of a transition from one physically arduous activity to another at different sections (“pieces”) of the vast estate of Rose Hall. In addition, in this case as with Mercury and Arabella, enslaved persons could have utilized the particular time of shell blow as a particular signal for their collective, coordinated runaway attempt. After at least 6 runaway attempts, a note in the journal stated that on January 15, 1821 “Mercury sent to Montego-Bay Goal [sic]” (vol. 1, folio 187). Unlike workhouses in England that functioned as almshouses, workhouses in colonial Jamaica were jails—sites of confinement, punishment, and torture. Two weeks later, on January 30 of that same year, a note in the Rose Hall Journal stated, “Mercury dies in gaol.” Mercury’s death at age 29 was listed in the 1823 Slave Register. It is possible that Mercury had labored at Rose Hall for years and even decades until he was sent to the gaol; the details of Mercury’s life before 1817 have not been uncovered at this time. The extant records do not include information about Mercury’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora. We do not know the names of Mercury’s parents; they could have been either African-born or Creole.

The other person named Ned was younger, Creole, and negro (in colour). This older Ned was described in the 1820 Slave Register as Creole, sambo (in colour), 2 years old, and son of Mary. His birth was recorded in the Rose Hall Journal on November 3, 1817 (vol.1, folio 26). Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Ned’s biological father. However, in the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, Ned was listed as 13 years old, mulatto (in colour), “able and healthy,” and of “good’ disposition. If he was described correctly in the 1832 list as mulatto, then he had a white biological father. We have no archival records indicating whether his biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Ned was born). His father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family. As his primary position was at the “Overseer's House,” it is possible that this position reflected a connection to the overseer. Ned was 1 of 3 children described as at the overseer’s house. The other 2 children were John Kerr and Richard Mabon, who were both Creole and classified as quadroon. Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume “consent” of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall. Ned had only one recorded runaway attempt. On June 9, 1830, it was noted that “Ned went out to catch the overseers mule & absconded before feeding it.” The mule in question was reported to have died (vol. 3, folio 75). Later in the month, on June 21, 1830, Ned was brought back to Rose Hall (vol. 3, folio 76). The details of Ned’s life after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. Mary had at least 4 other children (Ned’s siblings)—Jemmy, Sally Rose, John, and Allick. However, by 1832, 3 of her children—Ned, Sally Rose, and Jemmy—were alive. Mary’s mother (Ned’s grandmother), Maphe (Creole) only had one child—Mary. However, it is still possible that Mary and Maphe had other children and grandchildren who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall. The extant records do not include information about all of Ned’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora.",Domestic Workers

This Patrick was described in the first slave register of 1817 as African-born, negro (in colour), and 45 years old. It is possible that he had labored at Rose Hall for many years before 1817, but the details of his life before 1817 have not been uncovered at this time. Patrick ’s death, at the age of 56, was recorded in the 1829 Slave Register. A Rose Hall journal entry on October 28, 1828 noted that Patrick Sen died from eating a poisonous fish (vol.3, folio 23a). The extant records do not include information about Patrick’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or his native home on the African continent. We do not know the names of Patrick ’s parents; both were most likely African-born. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know whether Patrick was a biological father of children at Rose Hall or had additional children in Jamaica or in other parts of the African diaspora.

In the 1832 Clothing Allowance List Patrick is listed as 13 years old, “able and healthy,” and of “good” disposition. His primary duties and position were described as “Field” which meant he would have been one of many field workers who were responsible for planting, tending, and harvesting the sugarcane in the various sections of Rose Hall Plantation. Patrick was 1 of the 4 enslaved men who were solely field workers at Rose Hall in 1832, though he was only 13 years old at that time. Patrick probably had been assigned to the hogmeat gang when he was younger, and then he had been moved to full-time duties as a field worker. The details of his life after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. Miranda had at least 3 other children (Patrick’s siblings) living at Rose Hall—Memmy Jun, Glister, and Christianna. However, it is still possible that during her life Miranda had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall.

He was described in the first slave register of 1817 as Creole, negro (in colour), 18 years old, and son of Rachel (African-born). Rachel’s only child noted at Rose Hall was Peter. Given that she was 62 years old in 1817, Peter may not have been her first child. In the 1832 Clothing Allowance List Peter was listed as 32 years old, “able and healthy,” and “indolent.” He was the only enslaved person listed as a “Fisherman” in 1832, but he was not the only enslaved person to utilize the conditions of his position as an opportunity to run away. The Rose Hall Journal included notations of two of Peter’s runaway attempts. Peter’s first attempt, mentioned in the Rose Hall Journal on December 13, 1828, involved Hercules; the entry stated: “Hercules absconded on the 13th Inst. from Peter in consequence of which Peter has likewise absented himself” (vol. 2, folio 29). In this instance, Peter seemed to be entangled in one of Hercules' numerous runaway attempts, and Hercules’ action in this case appeared to inform Peter’s own decision to abscond—perhaps it seemed an opportune time to run away or possibly to avert being punished due to Hercules’ actions. It is unclear why Peter seemed to be responsible for Hercules at this time. However, on December 15, 1828, the very day that Peter was brought back to Rose Hall was the exact day that someone was sent to the Montego Bay Workhouse (vol. 3, folio 30). That person remained there through the holidays, and he was not released until January 3, 1829 (vol. 3, folio 35). This person was probably Peter. His second attempt was recorded on November 30 1829: “Peter the fisherman being sent from the field to fish. Thot proper to absent himself for 3 days & was afterwards caught” (vol. 3, folio 60). Once again, it seemed that Peter utilized another situation involving his fisherman duties to abscond from Rose Hall. This particular description provides a sense of Peter’s combined duties of fisherman and field worker. It is possible that Peter had labored at Rose Hall for many years and decades; the details of Peter’s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. The extant records do not include information about all of Peter’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora.

In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, he was listed as 28 years old, “able and healthy,” and of “good” disposition. His main position was described as “Head Cartman. He was 1 of 3 cartmen listed in the 1832 list. Mark (Creole) and Ben (Creole), Pitt’s brother, were listed as cartmen. The cart was also described as the “mule cart” in the Rose Hall Journal. Pitt and other cartmen were responsible for moving goods between different areas at Rose Hall, between Rose Hall and other plantations, as well as transporting the byproducts of the plantation (sugar and rum) to the wharf to be transported to England. There are at least 8 separate instances of Pitt’s attempts at running away. On one occasion in August 1826, Pitt was supposed to be tending cattle with his brother, Ben (Creole), and Anthony (Creole). Instead, he absconded from Rose Hall with them; as a result, the cattle left the pen and destroyed a significant portion of sugarcane plants (vol. 2, folio 164). Pitt also appeared to run away with other enslaved persons, including Bolton, Archey, Hercules, Anthony, and Kitty. It is possible that Pitt had labored at Rose Hall for many years before 1817; the details of Pitt’s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. Pitt’s mother Augusta (African-born) had at least 5 children at Rose Hall, and all 5 of her children survived from birth to 1832—3 sons (Ben, Pitt, and Oliver) and 2 daughters (Brown and Clarinda).

His death was then later recorded in the 1826 Slave Register, and he was noted to have passed away at 77 years old.

The younger Sam was described in the 1826 Slave Register as Creole, negro (in colour), 10 days old, and son of Glister. Glister was also the daughter of Miranda (Sam’s African maternal grandmother) and possibly granddaughter of Memmy Sen (African-born). Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Sam’s biological father. As with countless other infants born in bondage in Jamaica and in other parts of the Americas, Sam’s birth and passing at 10 days old were noted in the same 1826 Slave Register. Sam’s mother, Glister (Creole), gave birth to 2 other children at Rose Hall—a daughter named Miranda (also referred to as Maranda/Naranda). Miranda was noted as 18 months old in the 1829 Slave Register and (listed as Naranda) 4 years old in the 1832 Clothing Allowance List. The Rose Hall Journal also mentioned a third child of Glister’s born on March 27, 1824. The journal entry stated that “Glister delivered of a Female Child which died within the Nine days” (vol. 2, folio 41). Glister’s daughter who died within the frequently referenced nine-day period is not included in the 1826 Slave Register. It is possible that, having survived to the tenth day, Sam had been named, and thus his death was recorded in the triennial slave register. Although the birth and passing of Glister’s newborn daughter were noted in the Rose Hall Journal, they were not included in the 1826 Slave Register. Glister’s daughter was not the only newborn who died within the nine-day period and whose birth and passing were not recorded in the slave register. Indeed, the journal also mentioned the deaths of other unnamed newborns. We do not know how the passing of Sam and his sister specifically affected their mother Glister.

Less than 2 months after he was brought back from his last runaway attempt, another entry in the Rose Hall Journal noted that he died on July 26, 1823, with no cause of death recorded (vol.2, folio 7). His death, at the age of 48, was also later recorded in the 1826 Slave Register. In the journal entries noting his first runaway attempt in March 1821 (and Scott being brought back the following month), he is described as “Old Scot.” This particular description perhaps reflected some sense of the toll of bondage on him on many fronts.

Rose Hall Journal entries mentioned Smith running away 3 times. On the last recorded attempt, Smith ran away with his brother, Harry (the Second Driver), and George (the Head Driver). On Friday, July 10, 1829, it was noted that they “absconded on the 10th Inst. cause Theft” (vol. 3, folio 50). Although there was no indication of what item(s) were stolen, it is likely that the men collectively engaged in this “crime” and ran away to avoid punishment. A journal entry noted that Smith was brought back to Rose Hall on August 16, 1829 (vol. 3, folio 53). However, it is unclear whether or how one or all of these men were punished for their involvement in this theft and/or for absconding from Rose Hall.

His father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family. Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume “consent” of enslaved women in these circumstances.

In addition to William Kerr, three other cattleboys, James, Othello, and Oliver, were also described as “runaway” on the 1832 Clothing Allowance List. It is possible their positions may have offered particular conditions and opportunities for their individual (and possible collective) attempts. William Kerr’s second runaway attempt was recorded on February 6, 1831 (vol. 3, folio 94). This runaway attempt may have been successful and resulted in his self-emancipation. The 1832 list was created more than a year before the British Slavery Abolition Act was passed in 1833, which took effect on August 1, 1834. The details of William Kerr’s life after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. William Kerr’s mother, Dorinda (Creole), was described as the only midwife at Rose Hall. She had at least 9 children at Rose Hall (5 of her children survived from birth to 1832—Sam, Anthony, William, Venus, and John). Dorinda (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of multiple children. At least 4 of Dorinda’s children passed before reaching the age of 5—3 sons (Morris, Allick, Surry) and a daughter named Eliza. Being the midwife at Rose Hall, and having experienced the passing of multiple children of her own, might have exacerbated the range of feelings Dorinda experienced about the births and deaths of her children and the children of other women at Rose Hall.

By 1832, he was listed in the Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List as 44 years old, “able and healthy,” and of “good” disposition. His main position was “Head Carpenter.” As one of the carpenters, and an artisan/craftsperson, he was responsible for building and repairing wood-based and other items at Rose Hall; as head carpenter, he also would have assisted, trained, and supervised the other carpenters.

She was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall; she was listed as African, negro (in colour), and 35 years old at that time. In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was noted as 49 years old, “healthy,” and as a “runaway” for her disposition. Between 1817 and 1832, Arabella ran away from Rose Hall Plantation at least 13 times. Given the number of her runaway attempts, she should have been listed as a “notorious runaway”—a term used at the time for enslaved people who frequently ran away from plantations. Arabella ran away on her own; she also ran away at the same time with other enslaved persons, including Charley, Oserus, Mercury, Mark, and Scott. Some of these may have been coordinated, collective runaway attempts. It is likely that when Arabella absconded from Rose Hall on June 3, 1832 (vol. 3, folio 125), this final runaway attempt was successful and resulted in her self-emancipation. When she absconded in early June 1832, this was more than a year before the British Slavery Abolition Act was passed in 1833, which took effect on August 1, 1834. The only other enslaved woman at Rose Hall who ran away more times than Arabella was Doshey; she ran away at least 16 times from Rose Hall Plantation within the 6-year period beginning in 1817 and ending when she passed in 1823. In the 1832 list, Arabella’s primary duties and position were described as “Field,” which meant she would have been one of many field workers who were responsible for the laborious work of planting, tending, and harvesting sugarcane in the various sections of Rose Hall Plantation. Like many other sugarcane plantations in Jamaica (and throughout the Americas), the majority of field workers at Rose Hall Plantation were enslaved women, and the majority of enslaved women at this plantation were field workers. Due to the significant number of enslaved men who tended to the larger livestock, were engaged in duties related to the agri-industrial processing of the byproducts of sugarcane, and labored as artisans/craftspeople, only a small minority of enslaved men at Rose Hall Plantation worked as field workers. It is possible that Arabella had labored at Rose Hall for many years and even decades before 1817; the details of Arabella’s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.

The notation mentioned that Bess’ mother, Jenny (Creole), had “delivered a girl.” Bess’ name was not included in this description of her birth (vol. 2, folio 23b). This was not exceptional; however, there were infants whose names were included in the Rose Hall Journal soon after their birth (before and after the often referenced nine-day period). Bess was included in the 1826 Slave Register for Rose Hall; she was listed as Creole, negro (in colour), and 2 1/2 years old at that time. In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was noted as 7 years old, “healthy,” and of “good” disposition. In the 1832 list, Bess’ primary duties and position were described as “Hogmeat Gang.” At Rose Hall and other sugarcane plantations in Jamaica and in other parts of the Americas, the hogmeat or children’s gang included children between the ages of 5 and 9. These children worked the same twelve-hour days as adults, and some of their duties included carrying manure, disposing of trash, weeding and picking grass, collecting food for livestock, and other chores. Jenny also had another daughter at Rose Hall. This second daughter, and Bess’ younger sister, was named Suckey/Suckie. She was listed as 6 months old in the 1826 Slave Register.

In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was noted as 27 years old, “healthy,” and of “good” disposition. In the 1832 list, Bessy’s primary duties and position were described as “Washerwoman.” As a washerwoman, she was one of the small number of enslaved women who was not primarily laboring in the sugarcane fields. Instead, her arduous work involved washing the clothes of the white enslavers of the Palmer family and any of their guests at Rose Hall. Her duties might also have been expanded on any given day due to the particular needs of the Palmer family and their guests. It is possible that Bessy had labored at Rose Hall for many years before 1817; the details of Bessy’s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. Bessy was the daughter of Sarah (a Creole woman often referred to as Sambo Sarah). As Bessy was described as mulatto, her biological father was a white man. We have no archival records indicating whether her white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Bessy was born). Bessy’s father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by John Palmer. Between 1803 to 1808, Robert McLaren was one of the overseers who worked at Rose Hall and possibly for a short time at Palmyra in 1820-1821. Given his timing as overseer at Rose Hall, Bessy being born approximately in 1804, and Bessy’s surname on the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, it is likely that he was Bessy’s father. Bessy had 2 sons—Richard aka Richard Mabon (9 years old in 1832) and Robert (3 years old in 1832). Both Richard and Robert were described in the slave registers as “quadroons.” Bessy’s son Robert’s “Christian name” was listed as “Lawrence Low.” Lawrence Lowe was one of the overseers at Rose Hall Plantation between 1826 and 1832. Bessy’s son Richard was listed as “at the Overseer’s House” in 1832, and Lawrence Lowe was overseer at that time. Moreover, as Robert was identified as a quadroon and with his particular “Christian name,” it is certainly feasible that his biological father was overseer Lawrence Lowe. Richard’s position at the overseer’s house did not necessarily indicate the breadth of the interactions between Bessy and the overseer Lawrence Lowe. Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume “consent” of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall. We do not know whether both of Bessy’s children had the same white biological father; we also do not know whether Bessy had children at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas. The extant records do not include information about all of Bessy’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora.",Domestic Workers

In the 1832 list, Cecelia’s duties were described as “Attending Young Children.” In 1832, unlike the other elder women in their 50s at Rose Hall, Cecelia was not assigned to grasscutting duties. Perhaps being in her 60s afforded her that limited benefit. She is the only person described as “attending young children.” The young children she attended were likely the 9 children (primarily under 4) who were described in the 1832 Clothing Allowance list as “not at work” (i.e., Eliza Hill, Edward Hill, Henry McLean, James Watson, Jane, John, Ned, Robert, and Sylvia). Cecelia most likely had labored in the sugarcane fields of Rose Hall for many years, probably multiple decades, before transitioning to this particular duty of attending to the young children. As mentioned in the book Unsilencing Slavery, given that she may have been responsible for attending to 9 young children (and possibly additional children in the hogmeat gang), this duty may have been onerous in other ways for a woman in her early 60s. We do not know whether she considered this duty a blessing, a burden, or both. As the eldest African-born woman at Rose Hall, Cecelia may have understood her job attending to young children as an avenue for sharing information about African history, stories, lessons, and cultural practices with these young children (and others at Rose Hall). Even as she attended to the young children, Cecelia also may have attended to the other enslaved mothers at Rose Hall, aiding and guiding them in the care of their young children in ways that integrated West African or West Central African cultural customs with which she was familiar. We do not know the names of Cecelia’s parents; both were most likely African-born. Cecelia had at least 3 children who resided at Rose Hall—one daughter Liddy and 2 sons Smith and Harry.

In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was noted as 59 years old, “weakly,” and of “good” disposition. Celia was one of the two eldest Creole enslaved women at Rose Hall in 1832; the other elder Creole woman was Maphe. Both were listed as 59 years old in the 1832 Clothing Allowance. In the 1832 list, Celia’s duties were described as a “Grasscutter.” In 1832, like the other elder women in their 50s at Rose Hall, Celia was assigned to grasscutting duties. Although grass cutting did not involve the usual laborious work of planting, tending, and harvesting sugarcane, the cutting of grass (which was collected to feed livestock) still remained arduous, especially for women in their late 50s in a “weakly” physical state. It is possible that she had labored at Rose Hall for many years and even decades before 1817. The details of Celia’s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. We do not know the names of Celia’s parents; both were most likely African-born, but we do know that Celia had a long-recorded lineage at Rose Hall.

In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was noted as 21 years old, “healthy,” and of “good” disposition. In the 1832 list, Christianna’s duties were described as “Overseer’s House.” Christianna had at least two children at Rose Hall—a son Henry and a daughter Jane. Christianna (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of a child, as Henry passed away at 2 years old in 1828/1829. We do not know how the passing of her young son specifically affected Christianna. Her only runaway attempt was noted in the Rose Hall journal on July 16, 1829 (vol. 3, folio 50), which may have been partially as a result of Henry’s passing. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name(s) of the biological father(s) of Christianna’s children. However, as both of her children were categorized as mulatto, their biological father was a white man (or white men). Their father(s) may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family. Given that Christianna’s job was at the overseer’s house and both of her children were categorized as mulatto, it is possible that her circumstances related to the white overseer might also have contributed to her desire to run far away from Rose Hall. Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume “consent” of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall. The extant records do not include information about all of Christianna’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora.

Due to the significant number of enslaved men who tended to the larger livestock, were engaged in duties related to the agri-industrial processing of the byproducts of sugarcane, and labored as artisans/craftspeople, only a small minority of enslaved men at Rose Hall Plantation worked as field workers. Dianna had given birth to at least one child at Rose Hall—a son James. In 1832, James was listed as 1 year and 5 months old. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of the biological father of Dianna’s son James. We also do not know whether she had children at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas. The extant records do not include information about all of Dianna’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora.

NOTE: In RHJ Dorinda noted as midwife at Rose Hall.",30.0,,,,,,44.0,Hospital Attendant and Midwife,Healthy,Good,90.0,Dorinda (Christian name/other name Rosy Mowatt and also referred to as Dorrinda),"Dorinda was Creole. She was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall, and she was listed as Creole, negro (in colour), and 30 years old. In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance she was listed as 44 years old, “healthy,” and of “good” disposition. In the 1832 list, Dorinda’s duties were described as “Hospital Attendant and Midwife.” She was described as the only midwife at Rose Hall. Dorinda had one recorded runaway attempt between 1817 and 1832, mentioned in the Rose Hall Journal on April 21, 1830; it was noted that “Dorrinda the midwife being orderd to the field for general neglect in the performance of her duty thot proper to abscond.” The next day it was noted that she returned (vol. 3, folio 72). As discussed in the book Unsilencing Slavery: “The reasons for Dorinda’s “neglect” of her duties are unknown. It is possible that Dorinda’s own children demanded additional time and that her children’s requests and her responses compromised her time and attention related to her midwifery duties. The cumulative effects of the loss of 4 of Dorinda’s children between 1818 and 1824 might also have informed her “neglect” of her duties related to other enslaved mothers and pregnant women. She might have been particularly neglectful with pregnant women with whom she did not get along and/ or did not particularly like. No matter what the reasons for her “neglect” of her duties, the harsh reality of her punishment of being ordered to the field undeniably resulted in her decision to abscond quickly from Rose Hall. Yet her decision to return the following day may well have been guided by her familial and communal connections to Rose Hall. Even if she had to serve temporarily as a field worker, she would still be physically close to her 5 children—one of whom, her youngest, John, was not quite one at the time Dorinda ran away. Indeed, Dorinda’s “neglect” may not have involved any “neglect” whatsoever, given the brutal, deleterious elements of slavery that reflected and exacerbated the precarity and disposability of Black life in the agri-industrial plantation complex in Jamaica.” We do not know the names of Dorinda’s parents; both were most likely African-born. Dorinda had at least 9 children at Rose Hall—7 sons Sam, Anthony, William Kerr, Morris, Alick, Surry and John, and 2 daughters Eliza and Venus. Five of her children survived from birth to 1832—Sam, Anthony, William, Venus, and John. Dorinda (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of multiple children—at least 4 of Dorinda’s children passed before reaching the age of 5—3 sons (Morris, Allick, Surry) and a daughter named Eliza. Being the midwife at Rose Hall and having experienced the passing of multiple children of her own might have exacerbated the range of feelings Dorinda experienced about the births and deaths of her children and the children of other women at Rose Hall. The extant records do not include information about all of Dorinda’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora. We also do not know whether Dorinda had additional children or grandchildren at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas.

In the 1832 list, Dorothy’s duties were described as a “Grasscutter.” In 1832, all of the 9 enslaved persons listed as grasscutters were enslaved women between the ages of 52 and 59. The majority of these grasscutters were African-born women. Although grass cutting did not involve the usual laborious work of planting, tending, and harvesting sugarcane, the cutting of grass (which was collected to feed livestock) still remained arduous, especially for women in their late 50s in a “weakly” physical state. It is possible that Dorothy had labored at Rose Hall for many years and even decades before 1817; the details of Dorothy’s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.

She was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall, and she was listed as Creole, negro (in colour), 20 years old, and daughter of Rebecca (African-born). Doshey’s death was recorded in the 1826 Slave Register; her age recorded at the time of passing was 28 years old. Her death was also noted in the Rose Hall Journal on November 8, 1823 (vol. 2, folio 21). Doshy was the enslaved woman with the most recorded runaway attempts at Rose Hall between 1817 and 1832. Between 1817 and 1823, she ran away from Rose Hall Plantation at least 16 times. She ran away on her own, and she also ran away at the same time with other enslaved people, including Mercury, Plato, March, Mark, and Charly. Some of these may have been coordinated, collective runaway attempts. The majority of Doshy’s runaway attempts were for relatively short periods of time, usually for a couple of days to one week, most of which ended with her being brought back to Rose Hall. There is no indication in the Rose Hall journal that Doshy was ever sent to a workhouse or jail, though she may have been punished with “confinement” in the Rose Hall jail cells (vol. 1, folio 240) or with other forms of corporal punishment (e.g., flogging). Doshy’s mother Rebecca (African-born) had at least 2 children at Rose Hall—Doshy and a son Exeter. Exeter passed at the age of 27, a couple of years after his sister (probably in 1827 or 1827—recorded in Slave Register of 1829). The passing of their mother Rebecca followed not long after in 1829. The extant records do not include information about all of Doshy’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Doshy’s biological father. We do not know whether Doshy was a biological mother of children at Rose Hall or had additional children in Jamaica or in other parts of the African diaspora. If she had children in Jamaica, leaving Rose Hall to visit these children might have been a primary reason for some of her runaway attempts.

Eliza Hill was described in the 1829 Register as Creole, mulatto (in colour), 18 months old, and daughter of Mary James (Creole). In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was listed as 4 years old, “healthy,” of “good” disposition, and “not at work” (due to her age). Eliza Hill’s mother, Mary James, had at least 5 children at Rose Hall—John Kerr, Henry McLean, Eliza Hill, Edward Hill and Peggy. Four of her children survived from birth to 1832 —John Kerr, Henry McLean, Eliza Hill, Edward Hill. Mary James (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child—Peggy. It is also possible that Mary James had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall. Mary James’s mother, Rosannah (Creole), was Eliza Hill’s maternal grandmother. Rosannah passed away before Eliza was born. Celia (Creole) was Eliza Hill’s maternal great grandmother, and she had a long-recorded lineage at Rose Hall. As both Mary James and Eliza Hill were described as mulatto, Eliza Hill’s biological father was probably a white man (in which case Eliza Hill should have been categorized as a “quadroon” at that time). Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Eliza Hill’s biological father. We have no archival records indicating whether her white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Eliza Hill was born). Her father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family at that time. Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume “consent” of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.

This Jane was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall, and she was listed as Creole, mulatto (in colour), 3 years old, and daughter of Sarah (Creole). In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was listed as 17 years old, “healthy,” and of “good” disposition. In the 1832 list, her duties were described as “With Mrs. Palmer.” She was 1 of 2 enslaved persons associated with this position. The other enslaved person listed with this duty was Charles (Creole), who was 13 years old in 1832. The range of responsibilities involved in being with Mrs. Palmer is unclear. That Mrs. Palmer had 2 enslaved persons attending to her (1 male and the other female and both in their teens) may have reflected the breadth and range of duties that included domestic, personal care, as well as more involved arduous work that required the abilities of 2 enslaved people on a quotidian basis. Jane Cranston had given birth to at least 1 child at Rose Hall—a daughter Lydie. Jane (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child, as Lydie passed at 7 days old. Lydie’s birth and passing were recorded in the 1826 Slave Register, which meant that Jane had given birth when she was between 9 and 12 years old. Jane’s young age at the time of her daughter’s birth and the unstated circumstances related to conception possibly contributed to the death of her newborn. Jane Cranston was the daughter of Sarah (a Creole woman often referred to as Sambo Sarah). As Jane Cranston was described as mulatto, her biological father was a white man. We have no archival records indicating whether her white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Jane Cranston was born). Her father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family. Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume “consent” of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall. The extant records do not include information about all of Jane’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora.

In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was listed as 1 year old, “healthy,” of “good” disposition and “not at work” (due to her age). Jane’s mother Christianna (Creole) had at least 2 children at Rose Hall—Jane and a son Henry. Christianna (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child, as Henry passed away at 2 years old (as noted in the 1829 Slave Register).

Jane’s father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family. Between 1829 to 1832, Thomas Wilkinson was employed as a bookkeeper at Rose Hall. Given the timing of his tenure as bookkeeper at Rose Hall, Jane being born approximately in 1831, and Jane’s surname on the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, it is likely that he was Jane’s father.

In addition, on her next recorded attempt, on July 31, 1830, it was noted that Juno ran away while “being pregnant” (vol. 3, folio 79). Perhaps being pregnant may have encouraged her to try to pursue freedom for herself and her unborn child. Juno had at least 7 children at Rose Hall—2 sons Othello and Robert, and 5 daughters Prue, Cecelia, Hope, Lydia, and Susan. It is possible that Juno named her daughter Hope, in honor of Juno’s mother Hope (Creole).

She was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall, and she was listed as Creole, mulatto (in colour), 14 years old, daughter of Rosannah (Creole), and granddaughter of Celia (Creole). In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was noted as 28 years old, “healthy,” and of “good” disposition. In the 1832 list, her duties were described as “G.H.

We have no archival records indicating whether her white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Mary James was born). Her father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned the Palmer family. Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume “consent” of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall. Mary James had at least 5 children at Rose Hall—2 daughters Peggy (quadroon) and Eliza Hill (mulatto), and 3 sons John Kerr (quadroon), Henry McLean (mulatto) and Edward Hill (mulatto). Peggy and John were categorized as quadroon, but we also do not know which white man (or white men) sired these two children, and again here we cannot assume “consent”—whether or not one or more white men sired her children. Mary James (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child—Peggy passed at 2 years old. We do not know how the passing of Peggy specifically affected Mary James.

In the 1832 list, her duties were described as “Field” which meant she would have been one of many field workers who were responsible for the laborious work of planting, tending, and harvesting sugarcane in the various sections of Rose Hall Plantation. Like many other sugarcane plantations in Jamaica (and throughout the Americas), the majority of field workers at Rose Hall Plantation were enslaved women, and the majority of enslaved women at this plantation were field workers. Due to the significant number of enslaved men who tended to the larger livestock, were engaged in duties related to the agri-industrial processing of the byproducts of sugarcane, and labored as artisans/craftspeople, only a small minority of enslaved men at Rose Hall Plantation worked as field workers. Parthenia’s mother Daphney had at least 2 children at Rose Hall—2 daughters Parthenia and Fanny. Daphney passed away in 1818 and Fanny passed away in 1821, a few years after Daphney’s death. Parthenia’s “weakly” condition in 1832 (at the age of 34) may have resulted not only from the physically demanding nature of being a field worker, but also the emotional toll of the passing of her mother and sister (in addition to the other traumatic aspects of being in bondage). Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Parthenia’s biological father. We also do not know whether Parthenia had children at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas.

She was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall, and she was listed as Creole, negro (in colour), 9 years old, and daughter of Zebra (Creole). In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List she was listed as 23 years old, with “one leg,” and of “good” disposition. Her duties were described as “Hospital.” It is possible that her particular physical situation translated into her not being sent to work in the sugarcane fields; instead, her duties were located at Rose Hall’s hospital, possibly as a hospital attendant (who might have assisted the midwife and hospital attendant Dorinda). Rose ran away at least 3 separate times between 1818 and 1830. Her first recorded attempt was mentioned in the Rose Hall Journal on September 1, 1818, when Rose would have been about 10 years old (vol. 1, folio 68). On her third recorded attempt, it was noted in the Rose Hall Journal, on November 4, 1830, that “Rose ran away making her Escape thro the roof of the Hospital for no cause” (vol. 3, folio 85). It is unclear for how many years Rose had one leg, but if she had one leg for most or all of her life, the fact that she ran away at least 3 times demonstrated her desire to escape even with this physical limitation (and on one occasion departing through the roof of the hospital). Entries in the Rose Hall Journal often included an overseer's comment that an enslaved person had absconded “for no cause” or “without cause.” This reflects one of the central tenets of slavery that inaccurately presented slavery as a beneficent act bestowed on enslaved persons by enslavers. Instead, it is important to point out that enslaved persons recognized countless “causes” for running away and other acts of resistance, whether they acted on this or not, given the range of violations and violences experienced in a state of bondage in Jamaica and throughout the African diaspora. Rose’s mother Zebra had at least 6 children at Rose Hall—Archy, Charles, Dianna, James, Robert, and Rose. Four of her children survived from birth to 1832—Rose, Dianna/Diana, James, and Charles. Zebra (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child—Robert. In addition, her son Archey was transported off the island in 1826 as punishment for his multiple runaway attempts.

In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List she was listed as 32 years old, “healthy,” and of “bad” disposition. Her duties were described as “Field” which meant she would have been one of many field workers who were responsible for the laborious work of planting, tending, and harvesting sugarcane in the various sections of Rose Hall Plantation. Like many other sugarcane plantations in Jamaica (and throughout the Americas), the majority of field workers at Rose Hall Plantation were enslaved women, and the majority of enslaved women at this plantation were field workers. Due to the significant number of enslaved men who tended to the larger livestock, were engaged in duties related to the agri-industrial processing of the byproducts of sugarcane, and labored as artisans/craftspeople, only a small minority of enslaved men at Rose Hall Plantation worked as field workers. Sabina’s mother May had at least 4 children at Rose Hall—daughters Lucretia, Joan, Sabina, and Peggy. May (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of multiple children. May outlived 2 of her children—Lucretia who passed away at 42 years old and Peggy who passed away at 17 years old. The extant records do not include information about all of Sabina’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Sabina’s biological father.

She was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall, and she was listed as Creole, sambo (in colour), and 40 years old. However, in the 1826 Slave Register she was listed as mulatto (in colour). Sarah’s death was recorded in the 1826 Slave Register; her age recorded at the time of passing was 47 years old. Sarah had at least 4 children at Rose Hall—Bessy McLaren (mulatto), Jane Cranston (mulatto), Molly Spence (sambo/negro), and William Swettland (mulatto); all 4 of her children survived from birth to 1832. As 3 of her children (Bessy, Jane Cranston and William) were described as mulatto, their biological father(s) was a white man (or white men). We have no archival records indicating whether their white biological father(s) were members of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before they were born). Bessy’s father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by John Palmer. Between 1803 to 1808, Robert McLaren was one of the overseers who worked at Rose Hall and possibly for a short time at Palmyra in 1820-1821. Given his timing as overseer at Rose Hall, Bessy being born approximately in 1804, and Bessy’s surname on the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, it is likely that he was Bessy’s father. We do not know whether both of Bessy’s children (Richard and Robert), described as quadroon, had the same white biological father. We also do not know whether Bessy had children at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas. Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume “consent” of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall. Sarah was also a grandmother of at least 3 grandchildren—Bessy’s sons Richard and Robert, and Jane Cranston’s daughter Lydie (who passed away 7 days after her birth). The extant records do not include information about all of Sarah’s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora.

Although for many pregnant enslaved women, the risks of being pregnant and on the run seemed unimaginable; for others, their pregnancy may have served to encourage, rather than discourage, them from pursuing freedom for themselves and their unborn children.
